Reproduce ISIC-2018 Transfer Learning Results
=============================================================
1. Download the ISIC-2018 DataSet here https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2018
2. Extract ISIC2018_Task1-2_Training_Input and ISIC2018_Task1_Training_GroundTruth into ./ISIC
3. Run ISIC2018_Dataset.py
4. Run ISIC2018_Transfer.py
5. ISIC_pretrained.pt is model pretrained on ISIC-2018 dataset, ISIC_trainsferred.pt is model further trained on Oxpet, ISIC_stats.csv contains the training and validation loss when transfer learning and metrics on test set.
